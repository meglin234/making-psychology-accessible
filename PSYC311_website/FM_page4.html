                <h3>The Justice System</h3>
                <p>Memory is a significant component of the justice system process; investigators, courts, and juries rely on 
                    these memories at every stage of a criminal case. Interviews done by police and testimonies given by witnesses 
                    are often key grounds for an arrest or conviction. With such a large amount of influence, the science behind 
                    memory has come into question in the context of the justice system. The belief that human memory is foolproof 
                    is false; research has shown that our memories are easily influenced and unreliable. This has altered the way 
                    memory is treated in court, specifically in cases of child abuse or historical sexual assault.

                <h3>Child Testimony</h3>
                <p>Any criminal case involving child testimony is already a tragic and sensitive topic. It is important to 
                    acknowledge the power imbalance between a child victim and an adult perpetrator, and that the child&apos;s testimony should 
                    not be disregarded on only the basis of faulty memory. However, while it is a common belief that children 
                    are incapable of making up stories about tragic things, this is false. This phenomenon has been found to 
                    be the cause of biased interview tactics used by the investigators and parents involved in a criminal case.</p>
                <p>Two cases that triggered the reexamination of interview techniques with children: the McMartin Preschool case 
                    and the Wee Care Nursery case. Both cases presented multiple claims of abuse and bizarre behavior through 
                    testimony of the child victims. These stories seemed undoubtedly true, as it seems unfathomable that a  child 
                    could imagine such things. Researchers began to examine the recorded interviews of these child witnesses and 
                    found extensive examples of coercion and suggestive techniques.</p>
                <p>In response to this information, they proceeded to replicate a criminal investigation scenario by providing 
                    interviewers with a fictional report and the instructions to conduct an interview with the &quot;victim&quot; 
                    to produce accurate information.<a href="https://eprints.lancs.ac.uk/id/eprint/129809/1/2018iordanoupdf.pdf"

                    and had strong confirmation biases, leading the children to agree and tell stories about a completely fictional 
                    scenario. This same procedure also addressed the common use of anatomical dolls, finding that these dolls 
                    biased children towards reporting sexual abuse.<a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/pdf/10.1080/09658211.2015.1010709"

                <h3>Historical Sexual Assault</h3>
                <p>The topic of memory has also arisen in historical sexual assault (HSA), given the amount of time usually 
                    separating the abuse and the trial. Memory is usually the only source of evidence in these cases and the concept of 
                    &quot;repressed memories&quot; is often called upon as well. These repressed memories are usually presented with a large amount 
                    of fluidity and certainty, a trend that has concerned many memory experts.</p>			
                <p>Experts contest that accurate accounts of historical experiences tend to be from a peripheral point of view and contain 
                    some errors, the result of the memory mechanisms undergoing long periods of time. This counters the common misconception 
                    that detailed, fluid accounts are correlated with accuracy. Research has shown that this is inaccurate, supporting that 
                    details often signal errors.</p>
                <p>Similar to child testimony, these findings do not discredit all accounts of recovered memories or HSA. Instead, greater 
                    consideration for the interview and memory retrieval process is being considered in court.</p>
                <p>It is once again important to refrain from using this research to discredit all claims. Instead, it is important for the 
                    justice system to ensure all collection methods to be unbiased.</p>
                <p>Memory, as an unreliable system, serves as a critical component of the justice system. It is unfortunate that the fate 
                    of individuals&apos; lives can rely on this system, and that is why it is crucial to approach testimony and interviews 
                    through a perspective that evaluates the limits of our memory.</p>
