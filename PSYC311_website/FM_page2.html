                <h3>Trama & PTSD</h3>
                <p>Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a mental health condition triggered by a terrifying event &#8211; either 
                    experiencing it or witnessing it. Symptoms may include flashbacks, nightmares and severe anxiety, as well 
                    as uncontrollable thoughts about the event.

                <h3>Memory Distortion</h3>
                <p> Memory distortion may be attributed to source-monitoring errors. Source-monitoring errors occur because people 
                    do not store memories with labels specifying where they originated. Instead, they use mental shortcuts, such 
                    as how familiar an event feels, to decide if the event actually happened. So, if someone starts to imagine new 
                    details of an event, those details will begin to feel more familiar and their likelihood of falsely accepting 
                    those details as fact greatly increases.</p>
                <p>Intrusions in memory, such as recalling an event that didn&apos;t happen, can be a stepping stone for misremembering more details, 
                    especially perceptual information like sounds and color. As demonstrated in the memory distortion study, asking participants to consciously monitor their thoughts on the film 
                    caused them to replay the film in their memory. This reinforced the film&apos;s content and lead to better performance on recognition tests.</p>
                <h3>Thought Supression</h3>
                <p>Previous studies have shown that asking people not to think about something actually has the opposite effect 
                    (they think about it) compared to those who are given no instructions. Further research has found that this 
                    paradox has two effects, the &quot;immediate enhancement effect&quot; and the &quot;rebound effect&quot;.</p>
                <p>When asked to recall a mixed list of negative, neutral, and positive words, people who have experienced abuse resulting in PTSD didn&apos;t 
                    remember as many positive or neutral words compared to those who haven&apos;t experienced abuse, however they remembered negative words very well. 
                    This shows that contrary to popular belief, ignoring trauma-related cues and trying to forget traumatic experiences is largely ineffective to 
                    those afflicted with PTSD.</p>

                <h3>Study on Memory Distortion</h3>
                <p>Participants were shown a film about a fatal car crash, however, some sections of the video were removed. 
                    The next day, the participants completed a surprise recognition test about the film, this time including 
                    the removed sections. The results showed that they were able to distinguish between clips they had seen before 
                    and clips they had not seen, although they still claimed to have seen about 1/4 of the removed 
                    footage.</p>
                <p>Participants were also more likely to misremember the major and important 
                    clips of the film, compared to the mundane clips. However, when the emotional tone of the film is neutral 
                    people are more likely to misremember the mundane clips, indicating that these biases are tied to emotionally 
                    arousing memories.</p>

                <h3>Associative Activation</h3>
                <p>According to associative activation, memory contains a multitude of representations, or nodes, that are 
                    interconnected by associative links. Whenever someone experiences and encodes information from an event, 
                    nodes containing information from that particular event will activate related nodes and concepts in their 
                    memory network. This activation will automatically spread to neighboring nodes, thereby triggering related 
                    memories that may or may not have been part of the original event.</p>
                <p>When someone with PTSD experiences a trigger, nodes related to the trigger are activated, causing related memories to surface and interfere, resulting in false memories.</p>
