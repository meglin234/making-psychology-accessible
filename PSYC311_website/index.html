	View source is a feature, not a bug. Thanks for your curiosity and
	interest in participating!

	Here are the submission guidelines for the new and improved csszengarden.com:

	- CSS3? Of course! Prefix for ALL browsers where necessary.
	- go responsive; test your layout at multiple screen sizes.
	- your browser testing baseline: IE9+, recent Chrome/Firefox/Safari, and iOS/Android
	- Graceful degradation is acceptable, and in fact highly encouraged.
	- use classes for styling. Don't use ids.
	- web fonts are cool, just make sure you have a license to share the files. Hosted 
	  services that are applied via the CSS file (ie. Google Fonts) will work fine, but
	  most that require custom HTML won't. TypeKit is supported, see the readme on this
	  page for usage instructions: https://github.com/mezzoblue/csszengarden.com/

	And a few tips on building your CSS file:

	- use :first-child, :last-child and :nth-child to get at non-classed elements
	- use ::before and ::after to create pseudo-elements for extra styling
	- use multiple background images to apply as many as you need to any element
	- use the Kellum Method for image replacement, if still needed. http://goo.gl/GXxdI
	- don't rely on the extra divs at the bottom. Use ::before and ::after instead.

			<h3>What are False Memories?</h3>
			<p>False memory refers to cases in which people remember events differently from how they happened. In some cases, 
				a false memory may be entirely imaginary.</p>
			<p>False memories can be very vivid and held with high confidence, making it difficult to convince someone that 
				their memory is not correct.</p>
		</div>
	</section>

	<div class="main supporting" id="zen-supporting" role="main">
		<div class="explanation" id="zen-explanation" role="article">
			<p>False memory differs from simple memory errors. While we are all prone to memory mistakes, false memory involves 
				confidence in the validity of the memory. It is not about forgetting or mixing up details of things that we 
				experienced; it is about remembering things that we never experienced in the first place.</p>
				<br>
			<p><u><b>Episodic Memory:</b></u> personal information and experiences</p>
				<br>
			<p>When discussing false memories, researchers are primarily referencing errors of <b>episodic memory</b>, in which an 
				event is remembered incorrectly. False memories can range from mere distortion of an event to the complete 
				fabrication of a situation that did not occur. This vast range of classifications for &quot;false memories&quot; leads 
				researchers to believe that there may be several cognitive mechanisms by which false memories are encoded and stored.</p>
			
			
			<h3>Why Do False Memories Occur?</h3>
			<p>The occurrence of false memories is largely unattributable to one cause, but researchers have theorized about several 
				factors which may influence the encoding of false memories. Below is a non-comprehensive list of some of these factors.</p>
				<br>
			<h4><u>Interference</u></h4>
			<p>Retroactive interference occurs when new information disrupts a previously encoded memory. As we are piecing old 
				information back together, there are sometimes holes or gaps in our memory that we try to fill with current knowledge.</p>
				<br>
			<h4><u>Sleep Deprivation</u></h4>
			<p>Sleep is widely considered essential for the consolidation of long-term memories, and loss sleep can 
				lead to difficulty retrieving information. One study suggested that sleep deprivation at the phase of 
				memory retrieval could increase the likelihood of false memories but also demonstrated that caffeine intake reverses 
				this effect.</p>
				<br>
			<h4><u>Emotion</u></h4>
			<p>Emotion has been found to significantly influence the development of false memories, particularly strong emotion. 
				A 2008 study found that intense negative emotion leads to increased proliferation of false memories, but other 
				research has suggested that the level of arousal is what is influential in an increased presence of strong memories, 
				not the negative aspect of said emotion. One 2007 research study found that false memories were more prevalent during 
				phases of high arousal, regardless of the positive, negative, or neutral nature of the emotion. High levels of 
				emotional arousal, therefore, may be predictive of the likelihood of the formation of false memories.</p>

			<h3>Examples of False Memories </h3>
			<p>1. Incorrectly recalling that you turned off a light</p>
			<p>2. Believing that you had called a friend in the morning, when in actuality, you had not</p>
			<p>3. Incorrectly remembering that you locked your car before leaving the parking lot</p>
			<p>4. Falsely remembering details of an accident you witnessed</p>
			<p>5. Believing that you saw a video of the first world trade building fall on 9/11 when no such video exists</p>

			<h3>Historical Research</h3>
			<p>Neurologist Sigmund Freud and psychologist Pierre Janet pioneered false memory research, but arguably the most 
				influential body of work on false memories has been conducted by American psychologist Elizabeth Loftus.</p> 
			<p>Loftus, along with colleague Palmer, pioneered the most in-depth false memory research, including the influential 
				1974 &quot;car crash&quot; study, in which participants were primed with words such as &quot;crashed&quot;, &quot;bumped&quot;, 
				&quot;smashed&quot;, and &quot;collided,&quot; after viewing a car accident. They were then asked questions such as, &quot;Was there broken 
				glass?&quot; or &quot;About how fast was the vehicle moving?&quot; This is arguably the most prominent and well-known piece of 
				Loftus&apos; research, indicating that language can subconsciously prime us to misremember details of an observed incident.</p>

			<h3>False Memory Paradigms</h3>
			<p>Cognitive psychology researchers have categorized several ways in which to conceptualize how and why false 
				memories form. One such model is the activation-monitoring theory, positing that memories are a result of
				 activation of concepts not involved in the initial memory-forming event but those which are activated 
				 upon the spread of interrelated information throughout &quot;nodes&quot; following recollection of the memory. 
				 Proponents of this theory maintain that subconscious and conscious monitoring is essential in order 
				 to &quot;filter out&quot; and decrease retrieval of false memories, leading researchers to believe that children
				  may have a higher proportion of false memories as compared to adults due to decreased ability to 
				  monitor the source from which memories originated.</p>
			<p>Another prominent false memory theory is associative activation theory, in which it is hypothesized that 
				our knowledge base contains many interconnected nodes which hold our representations of information, 
				including autobiographical memories. These nodes are then thought to be triggered associatively when we 
				experience any event. Over time, the connections between these nodes are thought to become deeper, and 
				associative action is thought to become quicker.</p>			
			<p>Fuzzy trace theory explains memory in general as being comprised of two parts; verbatim memory and gist 
				memory. When something is remembered verbatim, it is remembered very specifically and clearly, whereas 
				when the &quot;gist&quot; of something is remembered, it tends to be a more hazy recollection. According to 
				proponents of this theory, false memories are created when there is an extended period of time between 
				the encoding of an event and the retrieval of said event from memory. Further, researchers argue that we will 
				rely on gist memory instead of verbatim memory in this situation, thereby leading to increased false 
				memories.</p>
