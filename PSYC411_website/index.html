	View source is a feature, not a bug. Thanks for your curiosity and
	interest in participating!

	Here are the submission guidelines for the new and improved csszengarden.com:

	- CSS3? Of course! Prefix for ALL browsers where necessary.
	- go responsive; test your layout at multiple screen sizes.
	- your browser testing baseline: IE9+, recent Chrome/Firefox/Safari, and iOS/Android
	- Graceful degradation is acceptable, and in fact highly encouraged.
	- use classes for styling. Don't use ids.
	- web fonts are cool, just make sure you have a license to share the files. Hosted 
	  services that are applied via the CSS file (ie. Google Fonts) will work fine, but
	  most that require custom HTML won't. TypeKit is supported, see the readme on this
	  page for usage instructions: https://github.com/mezzoblue/csszengarden.com/

	And a few tips on building your CSS file:

	- use :first-child, :last-child and :nth-child to get at non-classed elements
	- use ::before and ::after to create pseudo-elements for extra styling
	- use multiple background images to apply as many as you need to any element
	- use the Kellum Method for image replacement, if still needed. http://goo.gl/GXxdI
	- don't rely on the extra divs at the bottom. Use ::before and ::after instead.

			<p>Digital flashcards work just like paper flashcards. They allow students to engage in 
				self-testing by using one side as a prompt to recall information written on the
				reverse side. However, unlike paper flashcards, digital flashcards are typically 
				created, stored, and accessed via websites and apps. Digital flashcards also offer 
				more functions than paper flashcards.</p>

			<p>Digital flashcards have become increasingly popular, and leading platforms such as Quizlet continue 
				to gain more users and add more features. Given digital flashcards growing complexity, many students 
				face a challenging set of decisions when using digital flashcards in self-regulated learning. Self regulated 
				learning is when a student is in charge of their entire learning process, starting from the planning of learning 
				activities and extending through evaluating the effects of those activities.</p>

			<p>When engaging in self regulated learning with digital flashcards students must decide which platform to use, which 
				materials to learn, and how to make or obtain their flashcards. After the digital flashcards are ready, they must 
				decide which learning activities to engage in. They also need to decide on the when and how often they use their 
				flashcards. Finally, as they cycle through each flashcard, students may choose whether to turn the flashcard around 
				and view the reverse side or simply move on. Further, if starring or dropping functions are available, they must deecide whether to 
				prioritise some flashcards and/or drop others from further study.</p>

			<h3>Potentially Effective Uses of Flashcards for Learning</h3>
			<p></p>
				<br>
			<h5>Retrieval Practice Effect</h5>
			<p>Educators and researchers often recommend using flashcards for learning because they help with self-testing, 
				which capitalizes on the well-established retrieval practice effect. The retrieval practice effect suggests 
				that retrieving information improves long-term memory of that information.</p>
				<br>
			<h5>Correct Answer Feedback</h5>
			<p>Flashcards typically contain a cue on one side and a definition or answer on the other. This allows students to 
				attempt to retrieve information cued by the front of the flashcard before flipping it over to see if they were 
				correct. The retrieval practice effect is enhanced by correct answer feedback, as it can help learners to 
				maintain their own correct response or adjust their response if they made errors.</p>
				<br>
			<h5>Spacing Effect</h5>
			<p>Another potentially effective way to use flashcards is by spacing out study sessions and individual flashcards. The spacing 
				effect states that long-term memory is enhanced when learning is spaced apart in time, rather all at once.</p>
				<br>
			<h5>Generation Effect</h5>
			<p>Flashcards can be used to capitalize on the benefits of generation. The generation effect refers to the finding 
				that material that is generated, or the learner creates, is better remembered than material that is simply read. For 
				example, a student is more likely to remember information if they create the flashcards themselves.</p>

			<h3>Digital Flashcard Functions</h3>
			<p>Greater control over progress</p> 
			<p>Ability to present different types of materials (e.g., graphs and pictures)</p>
			<p>Options to configure the order and frequency of flashcards</p>
			<p>Easy removal or retention of individual cards for further study</p>
			<p>Built-in games and greater varieties of practice questions</p>

			<h3>Key Terms </h3>
			<p>Retrieval practice = learning strategy in which one deliberately brings information to mind</p>
			<p>Correct answer feedback = turning over the digital flashcard to compare your answer to the actual answer</p>
			<p>Spacing effect =  the added memorizing advantage gained when learning events are spaced apart in time as compared to when they are massed together</p>
			<p>Generation effect = the added retention advantage gained when material is generated, rather than simply read</p>
			<p>Learning activities = different methods of learning information, such as self-testing, games, and reading & reviewing</p>

			<h3>Potential Factors Influencing Digital Flashcard Use</h3>
			<p>Flashcards are often used in informal, self-regulated settings outside of the classroom, where choices that result in ineffective or 
				inefficient learning are common. According to the desirable difficulties framework, some learning activities, such as retrieval practice, 
				appear to reduce learning, but actually improve learning over the long-term. On the other hand, some learning activities, such as restudying, 
				appear to increase learning but are effective in the long-term. Since students often priotorize performance over learning, they may opt for 
				learning activities and methods that increase short-term performance rather than learning.</p>
			<p>Digital flashcard platforms can be designed or configured to force users to check the backs of their flashcards 
				after attempting retrieval. Some flashcard services also capitalize on the spacing effect by integrating 
				algorithms that take the decision-making power away from users, thereby forcing items to be revisited regardless 
				of whether a user feels they have learned them adequately. In addition, dropping flashcards can be prevented by 
				design in digital formats, which could benefit learning by enforcing repeated testing and inter-item spacing.</p>
