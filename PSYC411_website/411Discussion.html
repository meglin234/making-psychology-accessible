	View source is a feature, not a bug. Thanks for your curiosity and
	interest in participating!

	Here are the submission guidelines for the new and improved csszengarden.com:

	- CSS3? Of course! Prefix for ALL browsers where necessary.
	- go responsive; test your layout at multiple screen sizes.
	- your browser testing baseline: IE9+, recent Chrome/Firefox/Safari, and iOS/Android
	- Graceful degradation is acceptable, and in fact highly encouraged.
	- use classes for styling. Don't use ids.
	- web fonts are cool, just make sure you have a license to share the files. Hosted 
	  services that are applied via the CSS file (ie. Google Fonts) will work fine, but
	  most that require custom HTML won't. TypeKit is supported, see the readme on this
	  page for usage instructions: https://github.com/mezzoblue/csszengarden.com/

	And a few tips on building your CSS file:

	- use :first-child, :last-child and :nth-child to get at non-classed elements
	- use ::before and ::after to create pseudo-elements for extra styling
	- use multiple background images to apply as many as you need to any element
	- use the Kellum Method for image replacement, if still needed. http://goo.gl/GXxdI
	- don't rely on the extra divs at the bottom. Use ::before and ::after instead.

			<h3>Discussion</h3>
			<p>A careful analysis of the survey results show that digital flashcard platforms promote key evidence-based learning 
				strategies. However, college students often fail to use these features in the most effective ways. While college 
				students appreciate the ability to individualize their study process through platforms like Quizlet, this may come 
				at a cost to their overall learning.</p>

			<h3>Positives and Negatives of Digital Flashcards<h3>

			

			<h5>Positives</h5>
			<p>Students engage in retrieval practices when they go through their flashcard sets, but they view it as a way to assess their learning, instead of a 
				way to enhance it. However, studies have shown that retrieval is a key strategy of evidence-based learning.</p>
			
			<p>Students often revisited cards more than once and utilized the star feature to
				highlight cards they wanted to pay most attention to. This practice, known as  inter-item spacing, is greatly beneficial for the learning process.</p>
		
			<p>Students also engage in interleaved practice, in which they use the shuffle function to mix different concepts, ideas, and categories during learning.
				 This practice has been proven to enhance learning and memory in domains such as mathematics.</p>

				<br>
				<br>
			 <p>Compared to traditional flashcards, digital flashcards are easier to create, store, and access. This results in digital card users generating larger study sets, 
				enhancing the spacing effect between individual flashcards.</p>
			
			<p>Some digital flashcard platforms offer features that make repetition decisions for the users, shielding them from being influenced by 
				overconfidence or retrieval fluency. While this aids in learning the cards themselves, it can inhibit 
				the degree to which students know how to self-regulate their learning strategies.</p>
		</div>

		<div class="benefits4" id="zen-benefits" role="article">
			<h5>Negatives</h5>
			<p>Students often fail to use best practices when it comes to making use of correct answer feedback, as they often do not check the answers on the 
				other side of the card. This robs them of important learning opportunities that augment retrieval-based learning.</p> 

			<p>Spaced (spread out) practice has been proven to be more effective for long-term learning than massed (crammed) practice. However, college students 
				often begin their studies the last few nights before an exam, robbing themselves of the opportunity 
				to engage in spaced practice.</p>

			<p>Students engaged in an ease-accuracy trade-off in which they were willing to use card sets that were suboptimal in quality in exchange for the fact 
				that these pre-made sets were more convenient to access (compared to making the cards on their own). Studies have shown that generating your own 
				content aids in learning, but students are seemingly too cramped for time to base their study methods on this concept.</p>

			<h3>Limitations</h3>
			<p>The study was conducted during the COVID-19 Pandemic, when most students were engaged in remote 
				learning, making them more reliant on online learning tools. </p>
			<p>All of the respondents came from one, fairly competitive college. The results may have differed if 
				the sample was representative of the general student population.</p>
			<p>The format of the survey may have left students&#39 responses vulnerable to suggestibility. </p>
			<p>The results of this study may not be applicable to the use of Quizlet anymore, as most of its advanced 
				learning features are no longer free, making them much less accessible.</p>
