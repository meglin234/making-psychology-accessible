	View source is a feature, not a bug. Thanks for your curiosity and
	interest in participating!

	Here are the submission guidelines for the new and improved csszengarden.com:

	- CSS3? Of course! Prefix for ALL browsers where necessary.
	- go responsive; test your layout at multiple screen sizes.
	- your browser testing baseline: IE9+, recent Chrome/Firefox/Safari, and iOS/Android
	- Graceful degradation is acceptable, and in fact highly encouraged.
	- use classes for styling. Don't use ids.
	- web fonts are cool, just make sure you have a license to share the files. Hosted 
	  services that are applied via the CSS file (ie. Google Fonts) will work fine, but
	  most that require custom HTML won't. TypeKit is supported, see the readme on this
	  page for usage instructions: https://github.com/mezzoblue/csszengarden.com/

	And a few tips on building your CSS file:

	- use :first-child, :last-child and :nth-child to get at non-classed elements
	- use ::before and ::after to create pseudo-elements for extra styling
	- use multiple background images to apply as many as you need to any element
	- use the Kellum Method for image replacement, if still needed. http://goo.gl/GXxdI
	- don't rely on the extra divs at the bottom. Use ::before and ::after instead.

			<h3>Self-Made v. Pre-Made</h3>
			<p>Participants had a slight preference for pre-made sets due to their quick and easy accessibility. 
				On the other hand, those who preferred self-made sets liked the ability to control what information 
				they included and they appreciated the additional review of deciding what information to include. 
				These flashcard creaters tended to care less about accessibility and more about the quality of the 
				information.</p>

			<h3>Digital v. Paper</h3>
			<p>Almost all respondents who used digital flashcards also used paper ones, however, they used the digital 
				flashcards more frequently than paper flashcards.  Additionally, their digital flashcard sets were 
				typically larger than their paper sets.  This is due to the relative ease of creating and sorting 
				digital sets. Respondents were also more likely to drop paper flashcards from their study sets than 
				digital flashcards, suggesting that spacing out cards within a study session is more attractive when 
				using digital flashcards.</p>

			<h3>Impact on GPA</h3>
			<p>No statistically significant results were found betweeen digital flashcard 
				use and grade point average.</p>
